###Color Flipper Project###
Hey Moe! This is the readme for the Color Flipper project. It's a cool little app that lets you play with colors!

What it does:

This project has two modes:

Simple Mode (index.html): Click the "click me" button and watch the background color change to a random pre-defined color (green, red, light blue, or light orange). The displayed color value will also update to match the new background color.
Hex Mode (hex.html): (Work in progress!) This mode is being built to allow you to generate random colors based on hex codes.
Project Files:

index.html: Main HTML file for the simple mode.
hex.html: HTML file for the hex mode (under development).
style.css: Stylesheet for both HTML files.
app.js: Javascript file for the simple mode functionality (makes the magic happen for the button click).
hex.js: Javascript file for the hex mode functionality (currently empty, waiting for your coding skills!).
How to Play:

Download or copy all the project files.
Open index.html in your web browser to try out the simple mode. Click that button and see the colors fly!
(For the future programmers) Feel free to open hex.js in a code editor and implement the logic for the hex mode. You can use the provided app.js file as a reference.
